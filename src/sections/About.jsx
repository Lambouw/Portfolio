          Hi, I'm <span className="about--text--name">Malte Lindemann</span>, a
          self taught software engineer. My first real taste of programming came
          during university through an introductory computer science course, and
          that was the spark. Since then, I've always been curious about
          software development, wanting to learn more and more.

          When the first lockdown hit, I decided to dive in headfirst. I spent
          hours teaching myself web development using online resources and
          documentation, and thatâ€™s when things really clicked. What started as
          a hobby quickly became a passion.
        </p>
        <div className="height-s"></div>
        <p>
          From there, I landed my first jobs in software development, and I
          realized: this is exactly what I want to do. I love creating solutions
          with code, tackling challenges, and always finding something new to
          learn along the way.
