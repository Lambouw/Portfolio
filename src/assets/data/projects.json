    "name": "Adaptive HMI",
    "description": "This was the first project where I was responsible for both the frontend and backend development. The project involved creating an adaptive Human-Machine Interface (HMI) for machines with varying configurations and was a core part of my master's thesis titled 'Development of a flexible and adaptive HMI for different machine configurations.' The tech stack for the application included React with TypeScript and SCSS for the frontend, incorporating Material-UI components to enhance the design and usability. The backend was built using a Node.js server with TypeScript, and the communication between the frontend and backend was implemented using WebSocket via the Socket.io library. For UI design, I used Figma once again to create mockups and prototypes, ensuring a streamlined and cohesive user experience. To connect the application to machines, the system utilized an OPC UA server, which managed the data exchange and control utilities of the machine's control system. This project demonstrated my ability to design and implement a full-stack application tailored for industrial use cases and adaptive functionality.",

    "description": "This project highlights my first freelancing work: creating a portfolio website for an artist and sculptor. The primary goal of the site was to provide a visually engaging platform to showcase the artist's diverse body of work, including sculptures, paintings, and mixed media. The design reflects the artist's unique style while ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience for potential clients, galleries, and art enthusiasts. The website was developed using React and SCSS, with the initial UI designed in Figma. This project allowed me to combine technical skills with creative design, resulting in a polished and professional portfolio that effectively represents the artist's vision.",

I was actively involved in all phases of the project, from planning the architecture of the new platform and selecting tools and technologies, to developing, hosting, and maintaining the application after it went live. // My primary focus was on the frontend and UI development, which we built using Flutter. For the backend, we utilized NestJS, while the database was powered by PostgreSQL. Throughout the development process, we relied on tools such as Figma for UI/UX design, Insomnia for API testing, and pgAdmin for database management. // This project not only strengthened my skills in modern web and app development but also gave me hands-on experience in delivering a robust, production-ready application.",
